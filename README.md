# Insurance Forecasting and Customer Segmentation

## Overview
Financial risk assesment associated with customers and categorizing them into different risk segments for better-targeted product offerings. The project focuses on:
1. **Financial Risk Forecasting**:
   - Predicting the claim amount for non-zero claims.
   - Estimating the likelihood of a claim being filed.

2. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Identifying the most profitable and least risky customer segments.
   - Classifying customers into segments based on their features.

## Data
The dataset (`insurance_data.csv`) includes information about customers, their vehicles, and their insurance details.

## Notebook
The Jupyter notebook (`Insurance_Forecasting.ipynb`) includes the following sections:
1. **Business Problem Definition**:
2. **Data Science Problem Definition**:
